                           ‚úâÔ∏è Email-Based Account Activation System with Vue 3 & PHP API

üéØ Project Aim (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•ã‡§ú‡•á‡§ï‡•ç‡§ü ‡§ï‡§æ ‡§â‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø)
The primary aim of this project is to implement a secure and user-friendly email-based account verification system that ensures only valid and verified users are allowed to log in to the platform.
It demonstrates how modern front-end frameworks like Vue.js 3 can be effectively combined with PHP APIs and MySQL to build a real-world authentication flow with the following core goals:

‚úÖ Key Objectives (‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§â‡§¶‡•ç‡§¶‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø):
1-Secure User Registration:
Users can sign up with an email and password. Their account remains inactive (status = 0) until verified.

2-Email Verification Link with Token:
On signup, the system sends a unique token-based verification link to the user's email using a backend mail service (PHPMailer/Gmail SMTP).

3-Account Activation via Email:
When the user clicks the link, their status is updated from 0 to 1, allowing them to log in.

4-Protected Login Access:
Only users with status = 1 (verified accounts) are allowed to log in, ensuring unauthorized or unverified users are blocked.

5-Frontend-Backend Integration:
Vue 3 frontend with Pinia for state management and Axios for API interaction with PHP backend.

6-Reusable & Scalable Code Structure:
Clean separation of concerns with composables, Vue Router-based navigation, and secure API design ‚Äî making it extensible for real-world projects.
